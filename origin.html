Software was my passion.  I was young, everything was new and I had a lot of enthusiasm.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para2" class="nCPara2 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">But around 2000, I stopped, and it took me seven years to figure out why.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para3" class="nCPara3 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">This is a self-discovery piece.  Writing it has been theraputic; it's taken me a lifetime to understand this much about myself.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect2" class="nCSect">				<h2>Rebooting my brain</h2>				<p id="nCSect2Para1" class="nCPara4 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">Several factors contributed to my declining participation in software. Some are reasonable, like having kids that deserved my time more than software did, and some less so, like feeling I couldn't do an adequate job implementing the ideas I had. That bothered me a lot, and I felt powerless to help myself.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para2" class="nCPara5 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">Three years ago I figured out how to start helping myself. I <a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/2004/04/29#item6832">decided to return to university</a> to resume studying Computer Science. I should graduate in April of 2008.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para3" class="nCPara6 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">Sometimes I tell my friends, "I feel dumber every day".  The more I learn, the more I realize I haven't learned yet!  The good news is I've learned enough to dream about my ideas again.  The bad news is, I suppose, there's still so much more to learn!  I know I still need to learn more before I can "properly" implement my ideas.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para4" class="nCPara7 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">Regardless, it's time to get started.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect3" class="nCSect">				<h2>Willingness to fail</h2>				<p id="nCSect3Para1" class="nCPara8 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">The name of this site was inspired by a statement made by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Backus">John W. Backus</a>, a legendary computer scientist best known for leading the team that invented the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran_programming_language">Fortran programming language</a>, and is also the "B" in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form">BNF grammar</a>. He passed away on March 17th, 2007. R.I.P.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para2" class="nCPara9 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">I learned of his death from <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2140">a post on the Lambda the Ultimate</a>.  His <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/20/business/20backus.html">obituary</a> in the New York Times has this amazing quote:</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para3" class="nCPara10 nCSectPara3 nCLevel2">Innovation, Mr. Backus said, was a constant process of trial and error.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para4" class="nCPara11 nCSectPara4 nCLevel2">"You need the willingness to fail all the time," he said. "You have to generate many ideas and then you have to work very hard only to discover that they don't work. And you keep doing that over and over until you find one that does work."</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para5" class="nCPara12 nCSectPara5 nCLevel1">When I read that, I immediately understood what had stopped me from moving forward.  Fear of public failure.  I know if I try to implement some of my ideas, my implementation will be naive, someone will point that out in public, and I'll be embarrassed.  I don't want to embarrass myself publicly because I worry it could affect my ability to attract work and support my family.  It's a reasonable concern, but one I simply must get over to move forward.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para6" class="nCPara13 nCSectPara6 nCLevel1">The year 2000 was the first time I had job uncertainty in my career.  Now I realize the fear of unemployment (starting with the dot-com bust and later the post-9/11 tech crunch) is what initially paralyzed me.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para7" class="nCPara14 nCSectPara7 nCLevel1">In 2004 I resolved to stop lying to myself and others about why I left university, go back and get the education I need.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para8" class="nCPara15 nCSectPara8 nCLevel1">In 2007 I resolve to stop worrying about what other people think of my work, acccept that my software will suck in the eyes of some, and just do it anyway.  I have to work very hard to build software that works the way I want, and improve it when I can.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para9" class="nCPara16 nCSectPara9 nCLevel1">I'm willing to fail.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para10" class="nCPara17 nCSectPara10 nCLevel1">PS: Dumber Every Day was my second choice for the name of this site.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para11" class="nCPara18 nCSectPara11 nCLevel1">PPS: I've already registered dumbereveryday.com. :-)</p>				</div>				</div>			<div id="left-column">				<div id="navigation">					<ul class="nav-links">						<li><a href="index.html">Home</a></li>						<li><a href="about.html">About</a></li>						<li><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></li>						<li><a href="links/index.html">Links</a></li>						<!-- <li><a href="software/index.html">Software</a></li> -->						<li><a href="research/index.html">Research</a></li>						<li><a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/">Jim's Weblog</a></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>		<div id="footer">			<p class="update">				This page was last built on Tue, Jun 5, 2007 at 12:14:00 AM with <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a> on <a href="http://macos.apple.com/">Mac OS X</a>. 				</p>			<p class="update">				Thanks for checking it out!
