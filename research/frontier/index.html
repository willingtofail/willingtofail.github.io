I used it daily until 2001 or so.</p>				<p id="ncSect1Para2" class="nCPara2 ncSectPara2 nCLevel1">I was an extremely active user, contributing countless hours of support for the platform during the Frontier 4.2 - 6.something days.  I wrote the first web-based content management user interface for Frontier in 1996.  It pre-dated mainResponder, the UserLand Discussion Group (discuss.root) software, Manila and Radio.</p>				<p id="ncSect1Para3" class="nCPara3 ncSectPara3 nCLevel1">Eventually I transitioned to using WebObjects and Zope for web application development and implementing content management systems.</p>				<p id="ncSect1Para4" class="nCPara4 ncSectPara4 nCLevel1">A couple of years ago, Frontier was open-sourced.  This was a wonderful thing.  Frontier is one of the platforms that most inspired me and influenced my ideas about software.  HyperCard is another big inspiration.  Some day I'll write about HyperCard here.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect2" class="nCSect">				<h2>I manage this site with Frontier</h2>				<p id="ncSect2Para1" class="nCPara5 ncSectPara1 nCLevel1">When I decided to create this site, I needed to decide how I was going to manage the site.  I could have installed an open source CMS in my web hosting account, but I couldn't use Plone, the one I know best, and I didn't want to have to learn a new system to get started, because this site is not so about me spending time implementing web technology, it is just a platform for me to write about software ideas and maintain pages about the software I write and like.  (Like Frontier)</p>				<p id="ncSect2Para2" class="nCPara6 ncSectPara2 nCLevel1">I decided to go old-school and use Frontier, because it's pretty much the easiest thing to use that would be fun and useful.  And it's appropriate, because I'm trying to go back to my roots, back to the time I was "into" software, and I was really into Frontier for much of that time.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect3" class="nCSect">				<h2>The Inevitable</h2>				<p id="ncSect3Para1" class="nCPara7 ncSectPara1 nCLevel1">Of course, Frontier's HTML framework hasn't kept up with the times.  I'm sure hard-core Frontier people who are still using it for web site management have improved their own copies, but the open source version I downloaded was basically as I remembered it.</p>				<p id="ncSect3Para2" class="nCPara8 ncSectPara2 nCLevel1">If I keep on using Frontier, one thing I would like to do, if I have time, would be to try to modernize Frontier's HTML framework.</p>				<p id="ncSect3Para3" class="nCPara9 ncSectPara3 nCLevel1">I've been modifying my copy of Frontier as I work on this site, fixing small things that annoy me and making obvious improvements to support modern HTML.</p>				<p id="ncSect3Para4" class="nCPara10 ncSectPara4 nCLevel1">Right now, I'm not committing to anything, I'll just say Frontier is on my radar again. Several people are working hard on the kernel, and I've always dreamed of participating there... but like everyone else that contributes, I'd want to do the things that interest me personally.</p>				<p id="ncSect3Para5" class="nCPara11 ncSectPara5 nCLevel1">The other thing about Frontier is its open source kernel is a great codebase for me to learn from.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect4" class="nCSect">				<h2>Working on Frontier's HTML framework on your own?</h2>				<p id="ncSect4Para1" class="nCPara12 ncSectPara1 nCLevel1">{glossSub("Contact", "Let me know")} if you'd like to trade notes.</p>				</div>				<div id="footer">					<hr size="1" noshade="noshade" />					<p class="update">						This page was last built on Mon, Apr 9, 2007 at 3:11:59 AM with <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a> on <a href="http://macos.apple.com/">Mac OS X</a>. 						</p>					<p class="update">						Thanks for checking it out!
