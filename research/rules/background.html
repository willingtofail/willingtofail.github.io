In those 10 months I saw a very small but talented team improve a complicated system faster and more reliably than I had seen before, or since.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para2" class="nCPara3 nCSectPara2 nCLevel2">The key to our success from a technology standpoint was <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/WebObjects/Developing_With_D2W/">Direct To Web</a>, WebObjects' declarative development framework.  It employs a rule engine and comes with a rule creation application that makes it easy to enhance your application simply by declaring rules and using those rules in your templates and controllers.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para3" class="nCPara4 nCSectPara3 nCLevel2">Lately we've been seeing some great advances in web development frameworks.  Some of <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>' core philosophies point in the direction of a more declarative environment.</p>				<div id="nCSect4" class="nCSect">				<h3 class="nCLevel2">DRY - don't repeat yourself.</h3>				<p id="nCSect4Para1" class="nCPara5 nCSectPara1 nCLevel3">If you only have to specify a rule once to affect behaviour application-wide, you're DRY.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect5" class="nCSect">				<h3 class="nCLevel2">Convention over Configuration.</h3>				<p id="nCSect5Para1" class="nCPara6 nCSectPara1 nCLevel3">It's not that configuration is bad, it's that having to maintain the configuration of every bit of minutia of every library you use becomes a serious problem.  But if your configuration specifies new conventions, you're winning, not losing.</p>				<p id="nCSect5Para2" class="nCPara7 nCSectPara2 nCLevel3">Many of Rails and ActiveRecords' "conventions" can easily be expressed as rules, and similar rules were bundled with the DirectToWeb framework.  For example, the label of a property called "firstName" would be "First Name".  In Rails, the convention is to name the property "first_name" rather than "firstName", but the result is the same - if you follow the convention, you can avoid having to configure the label of the property, because Rails can do it for you.</p>				<p id="nCSect5Para3" class="nCPara8 nCSectPara3 nCLevel3">Using a rule engine makes it even easier to create and follow new conventions that increase productivity.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect6" class="nCSect">				<h3 class="nCLevel2">Immediate feedback</h3>				<p id="nCSect6Para1" class="nCPara9 nCSectPara1 nCLevel3">When you make a change in your code you should be able to reload the page and see the change immediately.  Changing your application by modifying your rules rather than code should make it even easier to support rapid turnaround. This is something that Direct To Web actually didn't do as well as it should have, but the improvements to Direct To Web in the open source Project Wonder framework for WebObjects made rapid turnaround a reality.</p>				</div>				<p id="nCSect6Para2" class="nCPara10 nCSectPara2 nCLevel2">I think Rails is currently winning the developer mindshare war and is leading the charge for change in development practices.  Therefore, I want to create a rule engine similar to the one from Direct To Web to promote adoption of rule-based development on that platform and others.</p>				</div>				</div>				</div>			<div id="left-column">				<div id="navigation">					<ul class="nav-links">						<li><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li>						<li><a href="../../about.html">About</a></li>						<li><a href="../../contact.html">Contact</a></li>						<li><a href="../../links/index.html">Links</a></li>						<!-- <li><a href="../../software/index.html">Software</a></li> -->						<li><a href="../../research/index.html">Research</a></li>						<li><a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/">Jim's Weblog</a></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>		<div id="footer">			<p class="update">				This page was last built on Wed, Jun 20, 2007 at 12:15:50 PM with <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a> on <a href="http://macos.apple.com/">Mac OS X</a>. 				</p>			<p class="update">				Thanks for checking it out!
