I am interested in seeing the rule engine used for use cases other than scaffolding model objects.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para4" class="nCPara4 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">Starting with the D2W-like pages is a useful way for me to get started with using the new rule engine I've written, but it's also risky because I don't want developers to think that the rule engine is only useful for customizing scaffold templates.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para5" class="nCPara5 nCSectPara5 nCLevel1">Direct To Web made publishing databases on the web a trivial exercise, by creating pages to query, list, inspect, and edit objects, introspecting your model at runtime to tailor its display. It came with three "looks" (skins).  Each skin had templates for all of the tasks.  Note that tasks are a Direct To Web concept, not a concept you have to use to take advantage of the rule engine.  However, many web applications are task-oriented anyway, so it was helpful to use and adapt the Direct To Web templates in your applications.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para6" class="nCPara6 nCSectPara6 nCLevel1">Direct To Web included nine tasks:</p>				<div id="nCSect2" class="nCSect">				<h2 class="nCLevel1">Tasks</h2>				<p id="nCSect2Para1" class="nCPara7 nCSectPara1 nCLevel2"><strong>queryall</strong>: thispage presented a simple search interface for all of your application's entities.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para2" class="nCPara8 nCSectPara2 nCLevel2"><strong>query</strong>: this page presented a search interface for a particular entity.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para3" class="nCPara9 nCSectPara3 nCLevel2"><strong>list</strong>: this page presented a paginated/sortable table listing of pages of a particular entity type.  The query* pages took you to list pages.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para4" class="nCPara10 nCSectPara4 nCLevel2"><strong>inspect</strong>: this page presented each property of a single object of a particular entity.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para5" class="nCPara11 nCSectPara5 nCLevel2"><strong>edit</strong>: this page presented a form for editing each property of a single object of a particular entity.  It supported editing attributes and relationships (to-one, to-many and many-to-many).</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para6" class="nCPara12 nCSectPara6 nCLevel2"><strong>editRelationship</strong>: this page presented a way to choose objects for a to-many relationship of another object.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para7" class="nCPara13 nCSectPara7 nCLevel2"><strong>select</strong>: this page is like a list page but it also had an extra column with a "select" button in each row.  Useful for choosing an object for a to-one relationship.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para8" class="nCPara14 nCSectPara8 nCLevel2"><strong>confirm</strong>: this page presented a confirmation message with buttons to cancel or confirm an action, such as deleting an object.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para9" class="nCPara15 nCSectPara9 nCLevel2"><strong>error</strong>: this page presented an error message with a button to return (to some page).</p>				</div>				<p id="nCSect2Para10" class="nCPara16 nCSectPara10 nCLevel1">For the end user, this is similar to Rails' scaffolding, except no code is generated to render the pages - instead, generic templates consult the rule engine to get information from the developer about how they should display themselves and how to behave when actions are taken.  And Direct To Web contained an intelligent set of rules that reflect on the model to provide the defaults.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para11" class="nCPara17 nCSectPara11 nCLevel1">Therefore, from the developer's perspective it's a completely different experience.  Instead of being responsible for maintaining boatloads of generated code, the developer only instructs the system how to modify itself from the baseline and provide any custom behaviour necessary to implement their requirements.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para12" class="nCPara18 nCSectPara12 nCLevel1">I used the word "generic" above intentionally - a generic template that uses a rule engine as a parameterization mechanism is truly reusable, just like a generic class in Java or a template in C++.  Just like a generic array is better than a non-generic array or an array designed to hold only one type, a generic scaffold is better than a scaffold designed to work with only one type, at the time the scaffold was generated.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para13" class="nCPara19 nCSectPara13 nCLevel1">Your model will evolve. To keep DRY, so should your scaffolds.</p>				</div>				</div>			<div id="left-column">				<div id="navigation">					<ul class="nav-links">						<li><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li>						<li><a href="../../about.html">About</a></li>						<li><a href="../../contact.html">Contact</a></li>						<li><a href="../../links/index.html">Links</a></li>						<!-- <li><a href="../../software/index.html">Software</a></li> -->						<li><a href="../../research/index.html">Research</a></li>						<li><a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/">Jim's Weblog</a></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>		<div id="footer">			<p class="update">				This page was last built on Wed, Jun 20, 2007 at 12:16:05 PM with <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a> on <a href="http://macos.apple.com/">Mac OS X</a>. 				</p>			<p class="update">				Thanks for checking it out!
