I used it daily until 2001 or so.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para2" class="nCPara2 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1"><img src="../../../../../images/Frontier"  id="frontier-logo" align="right" alt="Open Source Frontier icon on Mac OS X" border="0"/>I was an extremely active user, contributing countless hours of support for the platform during the Frontier 4.2 - 6.something days.  I wrote the first web-based content management user interface for Frontier in 1996.  It pre-dated mainResponder, the UserLand Discussion Group (discuss.root) software, Manila and Radio.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para3" class="nCPara3 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">Eventually I transitioned to using <a href="http://www.apple.com/webobjects/">WebObjects</a> and <a href="http://www.zope.org/">Zope</a> for web application development and implementing content management systems.</p>				<p id="nCSect1Para4" class="nCPara4 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">A couple of years ago, Frontier was open-sourced.  This was a wonderful thing.  Frontier is one of the platforms that most inspired me and influenced my ideas about software.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard">HyperCard</a> is another big inspiration.  Some day I'll write about HyperCard <a href="../../../../../research/index.html">here</a>.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect2" class="nCSect">				<h2>I manage this site with Frontier</h2>				<p id="nCSect2Para1" class="nCPara5 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">When I decided to create this site, I needed to decide how I was going to manage it.  I could have installed an open source <acronym title="Content Management System">CMS</acronym> in my web hosting account, but I couldn't use <a href="http://plone.org/">Plone</a>, the one I know best, and I didn't want to have to learn a new system to get started, because this site is not so about me spending time implementing web technology, it is just a platform for me to write about software ideas and maintain pages about the software I write and like.  (Like Frontier)</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para2" class="nCPara6 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1"><img src="../../../../../images/frontier-is-interesting"  align="center" style="margin: 1em" alt="Picture of this document's editing window" border="0"/></p>				<p id="nCSect2Para3" class="nCPara7 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">I decided to go old-school and use Frontier, because it's pretty much the easiest thing to use that would be fun and useful.  And it's appropriate, because I'm trying to go back to my roots, back to the time I was "into" software, and I was really into Frontier for much of that time.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect3" class="nCSect">				<h2>The Inevitable</h2>				<p id="nCSect3Para1" class="nCPara8 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">As Frontier is no longer in widespread use for site management, its <a href="http://www.scripting.com/frontier5/tutorials/web/">HTML framework</a> hasn't kept up with the times.  I'm sure hard-core Frontier users/developers who still use it for site management have improved their own copies, but the open source version I downloaded was basically as I remembered it.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para2" class="nCPara9 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">I've been modifying my copy of Frontier as I work on this site, fixing small things that annoy me and making obvious improvements to support modern HTML.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para3" class="nCPara10 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">If I keep on using Frontier, it would be good to modernize Frontier's HTML framework.  I don't know if I would keep doing it on my own copy of Frontier or have it part of Frontier itself.  Not sure if I would try to improve the existing framework or fork it and improve that.  Obviously forking sucks, but I don't think backwards compatibility would be a goal of mine, so it would probably be the only choice.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para4" class="nCPara11 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">I'm not committing to anything right now, let's just say Frontier is on my radar again.  Several people are working hard on the kernel, and I've always dreamed of participating there... but like everyone else that contributes, I'd want to do the things that interest me personally.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para5" class="nCPara12 nCSectPara5 nCLevel1">Frontier's <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">open source kernel</a> is a great codebase for me to learn from.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect4" class="nCSect">				<h2>Working on Frontier's HTML framework on your own?</h2>				<p id="nCSect4Para1" class="nCPara13 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1"><a href="../../../../../contact.html">Let me know</a> if you'd like to trade notes.</p>				</div>				</div>			<div id="left-column">				<div id="navigation">					<ul class="nav-links">						<li><a href="../../../../../index.html">Home</a></li>						<li><a href="../../../../../about.html">About</a></li>						<li><a href="../../../../../contact.html">Contact</a></li>						<li><a href="../../../../../links/index.html">Links</a></li>						<!-- <li><a href="../../../../../software/index.html">Software</a></li> -->						<li><a href="../../../../../research/index.html">Research</a></li>						<li><a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/">Jim's Weblog</a></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>		<div id="footer">			<p class="update">				This page was last built on Wed, Jun 20, 2007 at 12:17:12 PM with <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a> on <a href="http://macos.apple.com/">Mac OS X</a>. 				</p>			<p class="update">				Thanks for checking it out!
