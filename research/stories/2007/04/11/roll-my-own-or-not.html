But unfortunately it's not on a platform I can do much real customization with.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para3" class="nCPara5 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">So if I want to be able to customize the site, does that eliminate certain options?</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para4" class="nCPara6 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">I would never consider WordPress, because it's written in PHP, and I hate PHP.  Nor would I choose MT because I don't like Perl.</p>				<p id="nCSect2Para5" class="nCPara7 nCSectPara5 nCLevel1">I'm not a big fan of Rails, so I probably won't choose Typo, but I won't rule it out yet.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect3" class="nCSect">				<h2>What must I have?</h2>				<p id="nCSect3Para1" class="nCPara8 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">Be able to post using MarsEdit.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para2" class="nCPara9 nCSectPara2 nCLevel2">That's no problem, I just have to support the MetaWeblog API or any other API MarsEdit supports.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para3" class="nCPara10 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">Be compatible with my old posts.</p>				<p id="nCSect3Para4" class="nCPara11 nCSectPara4 nCLevel2">Nearly 8 years of posts is a lot of data to port over.

It gives me 6 full, completely independent hosting accounts.  I'm using one for this site, one for www.roepcke.com, and <a href="http://www.redmonk.net/">Steve</a> is using a site for one of his projects.</p>				<p id="nCSect5Para2" class="nCPara32 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">They support PHP, Perl, Rails, and supposedly it's possible to run Django on it with some work so Python is obviously available.</p>				<p id="nCSect5Para3" class="nCPara33 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">I'd probably use Python because it's the language I've used the most in the last few years.  If I use Python I could use <a href="http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/">SimpleTAL</a> or <a href="http://hathawaymix.org/Weblog/2004-10-05-01">Zope3's TAL packages</a>.  But apparently site5 doesn't support mod_python.</p>				<p id="nCSect5Para4" class="nCPara34 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">Of course they support MySQL.  They might support other RDMBS but I haven't checked.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect6" class="nCSect">				<h2>Am I nuts?</h2>				<p id="nCSect6Para1" class="nCPara35 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">As you can probably tell, I'm leaning towards rolling my own.</p>				<p id="nCSect6Para2" class="nCPara36 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">I think it's a healthy thing to do, because I need to get back into a designing and coding and improving frame of mind.</p>				</div>				<div id="nCSect7" class="nCSect">				<h2>Assuming I roll my own...</h2>				<p id="nCSect7Para1" class="nCPara37 nCSectPara1 nCLevel1">I'll need to design the system.</p>				<p id="nCSect7Para2" class="nCPara38 nCSectPara2 nCLevel1">For a while now I've been thinking about the benefits of static rendering. Back when I worked for CEISS I maintained their web site using Frontier, but it was actually an ASP/VBScript site as far as anyone else was concerned.  The templates in Frontier contained ASP/VBScript code.  When pages were requested the web server would process the ASP/VBScript code.  I've long felt this is a great way to maintain dynamic / data-driven web sites.</p>				<p id="nCSect7Para3" class="nCPara39 nCSectPara3 nCLevel1">Could a weblog system work like this, in part or in full?</p>				<p id="nCSect7Para4" class="nCPara40 nCSectPara4 nCLevel1">The thing is, you still want the (post/comment) data in a database so you can index and search it.  Right?  Or is it reasonable to put the content in files and use a non-RDBMS-based indexing system like Lucene or one of its derivatives to provide the searching capabilities?</p>				<p id="nCSect7Para5" class="nCPara41 nCSectPara5 nCLevel1">Maybe it's a moot question.  There's no reason I couldn't maintain whatever type of templates I write using Frontier, but depending on the architecture there might not be any point.</p>				<p id="nCSect7Para6" class="nCPara42 nCSectPara6 nCLevel1">The problem with having Frontier or any system spray semi-static/semi-dynamic files all over the place is those files have to be maintained.</p>				<p id="nCSect7Para7" class="nCPara43 nCSectPara7 nCLevel1">I'm talking myself out of it you see.  It's probably best to stick with the current, more MVC-oriented approach.  I suppose the system could use static files as a caching system.</p>				</div>				</div>			<div id="left-column">				<div id="navigation">					<ul class="nav-links">						<li><a href="../../../../../index.html">Home</a></li>						<li><a href="../../../../../about.html">About</a></li>						<li><a href="../../../../../contact.html">Contact</a></li>						<li><a href="../../../../../links/index.html">Links</a></li>						<!-- <li><a href="../../../../../software/index.html">Software</a></li> -->						<li><a href="../../../../../research/index.html">Research</a></li>						<li><a href="http://jim.roepcke.com/">Jim's Weblog</a></li>						</ul>					</div>				</div>			</div>		<div id="footer">			<p class="update">				This page was last built on Wed, Jun 20, 2007 at 12:17:24 PM with <a href="http://frontierkernel.org/">Frontier</a> on <a href="http://macos.apple.com/">Mac OS X</a>. 				</p>			<p class="update">				Thanks for checking it out!
